# My personal portfolio

This is a website dedicated to showing off my personal portfolio, it was originally built with HTML, JS and CSS, and then later moved onto the React framework. This website will show off my skills, projects and give a bit more information about myself along with my CV. 

The associated website to this personal portfolio is hosted on GitHub pages at the URL: https://harvey4452.github.io/PersonalPortfolio/

This contains all of my contact information too so please use that if you need to get in touch!
